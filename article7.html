        <p>Huawei at its pre-MWC 2019 conference unveiled the 2019 version of MateBook X Pro, which is targeted at jet-setting business users and professional content creators. The laptop, which has launched alongside the Huawei Mate X foldable smartphone, at pre-MWC 2019 event in Barcelona, Spain, comes as a successor to the last year’s MateBook X Pro.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Huawei’s new MateBook X Pro sports a CNC machined metallic unibody with ‘sandblasted’ finish, giving a premium look. The computing machine is available in Mystic Silver and Space Gray colour variants and is highly portable with 14.6mm thickness (max) and 4.6mm at the thinnest.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of the key selling points of the laptop is it’s ‘Ultra FullView’ display that has slim bezels on all the four sides and gives around 91% screen-to-body ratio. This has a 3:2 aspect ratio display, something which is there in MateBook 13 and 14 as well. There is a 13.9-inch LTPS panel with 3K resolution (3000x2000 pixels) and 100% sRGB colour gamut support. The top variant also gives an option of touchscreen support.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Powered by Intel Core i7 8th-gen processor, the MateBook X Pro also equips Nvidia GeForce MX250 with dedicated GDDR5 VRAM. What keeps the device cool is the company’s own Shark Fin Fan 2.0 tech for more air output. In addition to supporting Dolby Atmos audio support, the laptop has quad speakers, something that makes it a good multimedia laptop as well.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For connectivity, the portable computing machine has Thunderbolt 3 port and is claimed to support ‘world’s fastest Wi-Fi speed’ (up to 1733Mbps) along with Bluetooth support.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Huawei Mate X Pro makes use of upgraded Huawei Share 3.0 OneHop wireless data sharing tech. This is in addition to the Clipboard sharing feature that is also present in the less powerful MateBook 13 and MateBook 14 laptops.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For easy login, Huawei has developed what it calls is the ‘Fingerprint Power Button 2.0’ that is not the only laptop’s power button but a fingerprint sensor as well.</p>
