    <p>After introducing its Zenbook 2018 line up in Taiwan back in August last year, Asus has finally brought its Zenbook 13-inch, 14-inch and 15-inch models to the Indian shelves. The firm claims these new computing machines as one of the most compact laptops in the markets right now.</p>
    <p>While the Asus Zenbook 15 (UX533) is being touted for its ‘immersive’ 4K display, physical numeric keypad and a more lifestyle-centric design, the ZenBook 14 (UX433) and 13 (UX333) is highlighted for its compact profile, lost lasting battery backup and much more. The laptops have the iconic ‘ErgoLift’ hinge, something we have seen in other ZenBook laptops as well.</p>
