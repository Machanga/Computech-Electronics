              <p class="article3line2">Smartphone cameras have become great in the last decade, but there are still some things they can't do. In fact, I bet these shortcomings have unconsciously trained many of us to avoid taking photos in certain situations: dimly lit restaurants, starry skies, a squirrel sitting in a tree — why bother taking a photo if you know the shot is going to look like crap?</p>
              <p class="article3line2">The Huawei P30 Pro is here to change this notion.</p>

              <p class="article5line2">Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has announced on its Mi Forum that seven older smartphones in its Redmi series will no longer be getting latest MIUI upgrade. This means that these phones will not get the upcoming MIUI 11 update or any Global Beta update going ahead. Without MIUI 11 upgrade, users of these smartphones will not get the feature which removes advertisements. Xiaomi, however, will continue to provide Android security updates for now. These seven phones include: Redmi 3S/Prime, Redmi Pro, Redmi 4 Prime, Redmi 4A, Redmi 4 Global, Redmi Note 4 (Mediatek variant) and Redmi Note 3 (Mediatek variant).</p>
